An R Package That Exports Plots to Pre-defined Sizes and File Types

In particular, supports the file sizes used by [Society6](www.society6.com) for their artist submission [guidelines](https://society6.com/help/selling).

Works best with latest versions of R and RStudio

Note that if you've updated your OSX recently, you will need to download and install the latest version of xQuartz:
